# React E-commerce Shopping Cart

E-commerce Shopping Cart using React hooks like `useContext`, `useReducer` and
`useId`.

## The reason behind this project

This project comes from `Midudev's React Crash Curse` on YouTube:

- [Shop and Cart with React + Global State using useContext, useReducer and
  useId (2:02:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9tDYAZZxcE&list=PLUofhDIg_38q4D0xNWp7FEHOTcZhjWJ29&index=6)
  - Title translated by me. The original is in spanish.

In this video he shows a Technical Test and he leverage the experience teaching
how to use the React hooks like `useContext`, `useReducer` and `useId`

## Technical Test Statement

### E-commerce

- Display a list of products sourced from a JSON.
- Add a filter by category.
- Add a filter by price.

Utilize `useContext` to avoid passing unnecessary props.

### Shopping Cart

- Allow adding products to the cart.
- Enable removing products from the cart.
- Enable modifying the quantity of products in the cart.
- Synchronize changes in the cart with the list of products.
- Save the cart in localStorage for recovery upon page reload. (extra points)
